<p>Hi I’m Jamaal Roach and welcome to my blog.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>This tiny corner of the internet is a space for my fidling around with the statistical R to analyse and visualise data. The posts will mostly be driven by curiosity where a random thought sends me on a quest to find an answer from the available information. I intend to cover a wide range but don’t be too alarmed if there are more than a few posts about football #FC Barcelona. I’m from <a href="https://www.visitbarbados.org/">Barbados</a> so you can expect more than a few <a href="https://barbados.org/people/index.htm#.W8ql5GhKhhE">Bajan</a> and Caribbean culture references along the way.</p>
<p>I’m really interested in feedback whether it be on the subject matter , the analysis, the code or just the writing itself, so please feel free to commment or contact me on social media.</p>

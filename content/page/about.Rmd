Hi I'm Jamaal Roach and welcome to my blog. 

<img alt = 'my new screenshot' height='450' src='/img/me2.jpg'/>

This tiny corner of the internet is a space for my fiddling around with R to analyse and visualise data. The posts will mostly be driven by curiosity where a random thought sends me on a quest to find an answer from the available information. I intend to cover a wide range of subjects but don't be too alarmed if there are more than a few posts about football (#FC Barcelona). I'm from [Barbados](https://www.visitbarbados.org/) so be prepared to learn some  [Bajan](https://barbados.org/people/index.htm#.W8ql5GhKhhE) and Caribbean culture references along the way.

I'm really interested in feedback so please feel free to commment or contact me on social media whether it be on the subject matter , the analysis, the code or just the writing itself.

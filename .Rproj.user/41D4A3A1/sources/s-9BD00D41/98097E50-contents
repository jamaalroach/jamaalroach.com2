HI'm Jamaal Roach and welcome to my blog. 

![]("img/heatwave.jpg")

This tiny corner of the internet is a space for the statistics, data analysis and visualisation projects I undertake as I learn skills towards making a career change. The posts will include personal project- where I'm curious about a subject and seek the data to analyse/ visualise and assignments from courses i'm taking. I'm from [Barbados](https://www.visitbarbados.org/) so expect more than a few Bajan and Caribbean culture references along the way.

I hope you find it  interesting and come way from each post learning something new and I'm really interested in your feedback so feel free to commment on the posts or contact me, whether it be on the subject matter , the analysis, the code or just the writing itself.

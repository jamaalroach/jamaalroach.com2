      <description>The QuestionBarbados is hot. It was always hot, its a tropical paradise in the Caribbean its supposed to be hot but for Bajans, in recent times it feels hotter than ever before. The heat is oppressive , making a five minute walk at midday seem like a journey through hell and forget about driving with your window down to enjoy the breeze.
This is no surprise, everyone knows the earth is getting warmer.</description>

      <description>Ok, so this is not the football related content I had in mind BUT… this analysis of Donald Trump’s tweets on the Variance Explained blog got me thinking about twitter text mining and sentiment analysis.
Now fooball twitter especially, is a treasure trove of sentiment in 280 characters or less. Everyday football fans tweet about clubs, players, managers and tactics. But what i wanted to focus on are the tweets posted live during games.</description>

      <description>Barbados is hot! It’s a tropical paradise in the Caribbean it’s always been hot, but these days, thanks to global warming, it is hotter than ever before. Exactly how hot is it?
The devil went to hell to escape the heat in Barbados
&amp;mdash; Unreliable Narrator (@CorinBailey) July 25, 2018  That sums it up perfectly, the question isn’t if Barbados is getting warmer, that’s a definite.</description>

      <description>Hi I’m Jamaal Roach and welcome to my blog.
Figure 1: MeThis tiny corner of the internet is a space for my fiddling around with R to analyse and visualise data. The posts will mostly be driven by curiosity where a random thought sends me on a quest to find an answer from the available information. I intend to cover a wide range of subjects but don’t be too alarmed if there are more than a few posts about football (#FC Barcelona).</description>

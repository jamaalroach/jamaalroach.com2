      <description>The QuestionBarbados is hot. It was always hot, its a tropical paradise in the Caribbean its supposed to be hot but for Bajans, in recent times it feels hotter than ever before. The heat is oppressive , making a five minute walk at midday seem like a journey through hell and forget about driving with your window down to enjoy the breeze.
This is no surprise, everyone knows the earth is getting warmer.</description>

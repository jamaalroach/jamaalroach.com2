      <description>The QuestionBarbados is hot. It was always hot, its a tropical paradise in the Caribbean its supposed to be hot but for Bajans, in recent times it feels hotter than ever before. The heat is oppressive , making a five minute walk at midday seem like a journey through hell and forget about driving with your window down to enjoy the breeze.
This is no surprise, everyone knows the earth is getting warmer.</description>

      <description>Barbados is hot! It’s a tropical paradise in the Caribbean it’s always been hot, but these days, thanks to global warming, it is hotter than ever before. Exactly how hot is it?
The devil went to hell to escape the heat in Barbados

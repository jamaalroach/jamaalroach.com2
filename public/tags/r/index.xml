      <description>Ok, so this is not the football related content I had in mind BUT this analysis of Donald Trump’s tweets on the Variance Explained blog got me thinking about twitter text mining and sentiment analysis.
Now fooball twitter especially, is a treasure trove of sentiment in 280 characters or less. Everyday football fans tweet about clubs, players, managers and tactics. But what i wanted to focus on are the tweets posted live during games.</description>

      <description>Barbados is hot! It’s a tropical paradise in the Caribbean it’s always been hot, but these days, thanks to global warming, it is hotter than ever before. Exactly how hot is it?
The devil went to hell to escape the heat in Barbados
&amp;mdash; Unreliable Narrator (@CorinBailey) July 25, 2018  That sums it up perfectly, the question isn’t if Barbados is getting warmer, that’s a definite.</description>
